# SignalArc Agent / MCP Roadmap

## Scope

Backend/API agent only. No frontend chat UI.

## Goal

Build a separate agent execution path for SignalArc.

Agent can later:
- read markets
- create market
- trade YES / NO
- claim refund
- claim payout
- resolve/cancel only if authorized

## Core Rule

Backend remains source of truth.

Agent must not bypass backend.

## Contract Separation

Current user/frontend contracts stay untouched:

SignalArcMarketFactory -> SignalArcMarket

Future agent contracts:

SignalArcAgentMarketFactory -> SignalArcAgentMarket

Planned files:
- contracts/src/agent/SignalArcAgentMarket.sol
- contracts/src/agent/SignalArcAgentMarketFactory.sol

Rules:
- Do not modify current live contracts.
- Do not reuse current factory address.
- Deploy new agent factory later.
- Agent contracts stay testnet-only until validated.
- Add Foundry tests before deployment.

## Planned Backend Agent API

- POST /agent/intents
- POST /agent/intents/{id}/confirm
- GET /agent/intents/{id}
- GET /agent/activity
- GET /agent/markets
- GET /agent/positions
- GET /agent/claimable

## Planned Actions

- create_market
- buy_yes
- buy_no
- cancel_market
- close_market
- resolve_market
- claim_refund
- claim_payout

## MCP Boundary

Arc MCP is only for developer tooling and official docs lookup.

Arc MCP is not the runtime trading agent.

## Circle Agent Wallet Boundary

Circle Agent Wallet is planned, not integrated.

Before implementation:
- verify supported blockchains
- verify Arc Testnet support
- verify SDK/CLI path
- verify faucet/funding path

If not documented, mark as unknown / not documented.

## Implementation Order

1. Separate agent contract prototype — DONE
2. Foundry tests — DONE
3. Agent factory deploy on Arc Testnet — NEXT
4. Backend Agent API intent model
5. Backend execution path to agent contract
6. Circle Agent Wallet proof of concept
7. Policy-limited agent wallet execution

## Non-Claims
